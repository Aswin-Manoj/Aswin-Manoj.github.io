# Hosting a Markdown Resume on GitHub Pages

## The Purpose

After going through this README, it will have served two purposes: 

1. To provide a detailed guide on the practical steps for hosting and formatting a Markdown resume on GitHub Pages.

2. To draw connections between the above practical steps and the principles of modern technical writing described by Andrew Etter in his book, "Modern Technical Writing".

## Prerequisites

>Ensure you have a resume in Markdown format.

If you are unfamiliar with Markdown, here are some useful guides to help you get started:

- Visit this [link](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) to have a general understanding of Markdown.
- Visit this [link](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) for an quick and easy tutorial on the basics of Markdown.
- Since, we will be focussing on hosting a Markdown formatted resume on Github Pages, here is a [link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to some useful syntax on GitHub Flavoured Markdown.


~~~
In his book "Modern Technical Writing", Andrew Etter emphasizes the use of lightweight 
markup languages, such as Markdown ,due to their simplicity and readability. By using
Markdown for your resume, you make your resume accessible and easily editable. 

Markdown's easy to understand syntax improves readability according to Andrew Etter. He
mentions in his book that content should be easily understandable in its raw or original
form, and by using Markdown we are mirroring this principle.
